I will use the Temples Task as a template, and within my project I hope to encorporate everything that I have learned within this 7 weeks block.
The theme for my Final Project is: Temples of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Africa.
It going to be more like a quize and general knowledge page.

My source will be: https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples/list?lang=eng
Reference: https://news-africa.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/more-temples-announced-for-africa-in-2023#:~:text=There%20are%20currently%2019%20Temples,South%20Africa%20and%20Accra%20Ghana.

First the user will be asked the following questions:
1. How many Temples are operational in Africa?
2. How many Temples are under construction in Africa?
3. How many Temple have been announced to date by President Nelson?

Once the user is done with the quize they will get a score out of 3.
Then the following information will be displayed:

There are five (5) operational LDS Temples in Africa.
The images of the 5 Temples will be displayed.
> Aba Nigeria Temple
> Accra Ghana Temple
> Durban South Africa Temple
> Johannesburg South Africa Temple
> Kinshasa Democratic Republic of Congo Temple
When the user clicks on an images of the five Temples. The following information will display:
