I will use the Temples Task as a template.
The theme for my Final Project is: Temples of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Africa.
It going to be more like a quize and general knowledge.

First the user will be asked the following questions:
1. How many Temples are in operation in Africa?
2. How many Temples are under construction in Africa?
3. How many Temple have been announced in 2023 by President Nelson?

Once the user is done with the quize they will get a score out of 3.
